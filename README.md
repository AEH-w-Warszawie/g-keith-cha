My name is keith chatodza a fellow gentlmen with a  passion for computer science and thrilled to know more about the program 

Zimbabwe is a southern African country famous for its diversified landscapes, rich culture, and distinct culinary traditions. Sadza, a thickened cornmeal porridge, is a staple cuisine that is frequently served with vegetables, meat, or traditional stews. Another key food item, "cango" (a type of wild vegetables also called as "muboora" or "covo"), is usually served alongside sadza, providing a nutritious, balanced meal with roots in Zimbabwean culinary tradition.My decision to study computer science in Poland might be influenced by a variety of factors, including exposure to modern technology, a new viewpoint on problem solving, and the opportunity to learn skills that would help Zimbabwe's growth. This travel is a metaphor for venturing outside of my comfort zone, learning new methods to "season" my talents, and finally returning with information that can improve Zimbabwe's digital landscape.
